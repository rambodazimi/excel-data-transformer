The script offers robust error handling, detecting scenarios such as missing Excel files and displaying informative error messages to the user. With its intuitive interface and efficient data manipulation capabilities, the Excel to CSV Converter simplifies the task of transforming and exporting data from Excel spreadsheets, saving time and effort for users. Whether for data analysis, data migration, or data integration purposes, this script enables smooth and reliable conversion of Excel files to CSV format, empowering users to work with the data in their preferred tools and environments.

## Run the script

Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Open a command prompt or terminal.

Navigate to the directory where you saved thescript.py file using the cd command. For example:

Run the script by entering the following command:

python3 script.py or python script.py

The script will start running and attempt to convert the specified Excel file to CSV format. If the 'fsspec' library is not already installed, it will be automatically installed during the script execution.

If the Excel file exists and the conversion is successful, a CSV file named 'final.csv' will be saved in the same directory as the Excel file.

Any error messages or exceptions encountered during the script execution will be displayed in the command prompt or terminal, providing information on any issues that may have occurred.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the script and convert Excel files to CSV format using the Excel to CSV Converter.
